      <![CDATA[“By the time I was ten years old my bedroom looked like a nightclub. There were strobes, multi-coloured flashing lights, a disco ball, a DJ booth and a dance floor. When I switched on my equipment hundreds of tiny white lights would flit across my bedroom ceiling and walls. I switched on my disco ball every night. I only dreamt of one thing: making people dance.”

Laurent Garnier in “Electrochoc” by Laurent Garnier and David Brun-Lambert (Flammarion)

                                                          *********************************************

Laurent Garnier has been making the planet dance for 25 years. And, for all this time, his huge energy has seen him grooving behind record decks, bouncing up and down behind studio equipment and leaping around radio studios. He is a multi-faceted artist whose impact on the music scene is far-reaching. But above all he is a DJ, a true DJ: transformed by music, passionate about the crowd. Bodies move in a trance on the dance floor, minds elsewhere. Yet he is also a discoverer of old and new sounds, and has an amazingly rich musical culture. He spends most of his spare time sifting through old vinyl in record shops, following the most obscure leads on the Internet and listening to every single piece of music he is sent. Music, the pulse of our planet, is his Holy Grail. 

One of the pioneering DJs of the dance music scene, Laurent Garnier experienced first-hand the euphoria of the Acid House movement in Manchester. He then went on to Wake Up and shake up Paris nightlife, from La Luna to the Palace, not forgetting the Rex Club. As one of the leading lights in French dance music at the end of the 1980’s, he then spread his message across the planet, from raves to warehouse parties, clubs to festivals. The Excess Luggage 5-CD collection sums up the somewhat hectic life of this globetrotting DJ whose antennae are permanently ‘tuned-in’ to sounds from around the globe, current trends, and the music of the next generation. At the beginning of 2011 Laurent Garnier was the only Frenchman, amongst 35 international DJ’s, to be shortlisted for  “best DJ of all time” by the English magazine Mixmag. The latest in a string of accolades for this ‘turntable connoisseur’ whose incredible sets use both Techno from Detroit and beyond, and mixes in hints of Jazz, sweltering Disco, heart-warming House, African grooves, and Jungle and Dubstep basslines.

Musical eclecticism is at the heart of Laurent Garnier’s commitment to radio. At the beginning of the 1990’s, Laurent Garnier got behind the microphone, playing records on Radio FG, Maxximum and Radio Nova, where he remained a vital element for the next 18 years. Uncovering rare records, selecting new sounds and promoting new trends, Laurent Garnier has found a great source of satisfaction in radio broadcasting. To the point when, in 2003, he created Pedro’s Broadcasting Basement (www.pedrobroadcast.com), his own webradio that is open day and night and can be accessed across the planet. And as if that was not enough, for the last two years he has been presenting his own weekly radio show It Is What It Is  which is currently broadcast in France (Le Mouv), Belgium (Pure FM), Switzerland (Couleur 3) and Mali (La Chaine 2).

Laurent Garnier is an artist on the move.  He is tireless in his enthusiasm and is bursting with new ideas and projects. As well as the demands of his DJ-ing and his radio shows, Laurent Garnier has also evolved into a well-respected music producer. His first big hits (Acid Eiffel and Wake Up), both soundtracks to the explosion of dance music in France, have paved the way for a series of albums that are both elaborate and multi-faceted. From the Techno undercurrents of Shot in the Dark to the ambition of Tales of a Kleptomaniac, the electronic odyssey of 30, the maturity of Unreasonable Behaviour, and the visionary escapism of The Cloud Making Machine. In the space of five celebrated albums, Laurent Garnier has embarked upon a remarkable journey. A journey marked by some incredible electronic music anthems, loved by both DJ’s and the public alike: Flashback, Crispy Bacon, The Man With The Red Face, Back To My Roots, Gnanmankoudji, It’s Just Muzik. His discography is, of course inseparable from the story of F Communications, the label that he created in 1994 with Eric Morand and which brought to the fore producers such as Mr Oizo, St Germain, Jori Hulkkonen, AlexKid and Scan X. 

All of this musical journey is written down in the book Electrochoc that Laurent Garnier and the journalist-writer David Brun-Lambert wrote together and came out in 2003. In this biography, Laurent Garnier tells the epic story of electronic music through his experiences and memories. Electrochoc was a publishing hit and was translated into other languages including Spanish, German, Japanese, Russian and Croatian. It is due for digital release in English in 2011. In addition, Electrochoc is the inspiration behind a screenplay that is currently being written for cinema.

Aside from his albums and singles, Laurent Garnier is also a composer for the cinema, television and theatre. He wrote the music for the film SDF Go Home, the animated film Globi and the Stolen Shadows and in 2010 made the music for the French television show Groland. As for the stage, Laurent Garnier has composed the music for contemporary dance choreographers Angelin Preljocaj and Marie-Claude Pietragalla. During the summer of 2010 Laurent Garnier worked for a second time with Angelin Preljocaj composing the music for the ballet Suivront Mille Ans de Calme with the dancers from Moscow’s Bolshoi Theatre. All of these projects were wonderfully inspirational experiences that have had a huge impact upon him, both as a musician and as a human being, continuing a far-reaching career that is founded upon commitment and passion. 

Whether behind the decks, or a radio microphone, Laurent Garnier has managed to achieve his childhood dream: sharing the best possible music with other people. And little by little, Laurent Garnier the DJ has evolved into an accomplished musician, whose talents are widely recognised. One of his strengths is having understood how to take his own music on to the stage as live performance. From the Olympia in 1998 to the Tales of a Kleptomaniac tour in 2009/2010, Laurent Garnier has reinvented himself as an important live artist, defending his music and his vision as well as his sense of immediacy and need for improvisation. Surrounded by experienced musicians, Laurent Garnier lights up the stage like a DJ does a dance floor. During his most recent tour of about 100 concerts performed over a period of 18 months, he seduced different audiences from the Nice Jazz Festival, Benicassim, the Salle Pleyel in Paris, to I Love Techno in Ghent.

Following on from the tour, the LBS concept – Live Booth Sessions or Loud Bass &amp; Samples – was launched in the autumn of 2010. This concept has a smaller live format consisting of three people: Laurent Garnier (DJ &amp; machines), Benjamin Rippert (keyboards) and Scan X (machines). It offers a new platform for expression and improvisation, playing with Techno, Jazz, House, Dub, Breakbeat and Dubstep. This experimental live music project marries the organic and the electronic, with the flexibility of the DJ and the intensity of the live performance. Specially created to match the feverish atmosphere of a club, LBS work the dance floor into a frenzy with marathon sets. Five hours non-stop! It is a new way for Laurent Garnier to approach the dance floor…in the same spirit of giving…in close physical and emotional contact with the dance floor….as always…it’s is the story of his life.

      <![CDATA[Henry Saiz is the creator of a style that is a combination of his love for all things electronic with a deep passion for art. His music, as well as his work as a sound designer for film and TV has always been marked as forward thinking in approach and groundbreaking upon delivery. Henry's sound refuses to fall into a singular category, he takes in influence on many different levels and incorporates this into his live and DJ sets by forging a perfect balance of Electronica, Disco, House and Techno.

Henry's first productions were released through the highly regarded Global Underground and Paradigm Musik imprints. These releases were instantly noticed by house giant John Digweed, which led to creating one of the biggest tracks of 2009, which was also named as Pete Tong’s Essential New Tune. Released on Bedrock, Henry's remix of Guy J’s “Lamur” was regarded by critics and DJ’s alike as “the track of the year”. Following the success of this remix, yet another giant label; Renaissance commissioned the release of “Artificial Paradises EP” and “Madre Noche EP” in 2009 and “The Rider EP” in 2010.

Not a man to be content with such success, Henry whilst producing some of the biggest tracks around has also simultaneously been developing his live show. Using a combination of Native software and hardware, an Akai APC-40, Access Virus TI and other equipment, Henry has complete control over his meticulously created and fully original edits, loops and tracks. The integration of these techniques into his highly acclaimed podcast “The Labyrinth” and both live and DJ environments has allowed Henry to show his true potential in building sets that strike a chord with audiences across the world. His rising reputation earned Henry the honour of being asked to mix Balance Music’s 019 compilation. Following on from the likes of Timo Maas, Joris Voorn, Will Saul and Agoria, Henrys addition to this world-renowned mix series has more than lived up to expectations and has set a new benchmark in depth and quality.

Whilst being a producer, DJ and live performer is paramount to Henry, another element close to his heart is finding and developing new talent. Henry started his own label, Natura Sonoris (Nature Of Sound) in 2008 and it has become a platform for not only his own productions but also for artists such as Damabiah, Cora Novoa, Sistema and Ryan Davis to name but a few. The focus of the label is to connect electronic music with art and life. This is reflected in all aspects of each release from the music itself down to the artwork, a formula that has been received extremely well and now has a big following worldwide. September 2012 sees the release of his new single - Henry Saiz ‘Our Discovery’, which has been garnering a huge following this summer on the white isle, with supporters including Lee Foss, Sasha, Audiofly, Blond:ISH and many others.

Henry’s long awaited artist album is now underway, entitled ‘Reality is for those who are not strong enough to confront their dreams’. Due for release in February 2013 on his own label Natura Sonoris, this ground-breaking concept album engages his fans in an exciting and never-before-done way, by asking them to send him recordings and samples that he will incorporate into tracks from his album. Everyone can be involved in the creative process; fans can use the custom built interface on http://www.wearehenrysaiz.com to send him their thoughts, noises, field recordings or any other sound that means something to them. Be a part of his album today by visiting the site on your computer or smart phone.

Henry has now taken his DJ and Live shows around the globe. He has also been a part of festivals such as Sónar and Creamfields amongst many others and continues to be one of the most popular up-and-coming Spanish artists of his generation, having recently won the categories of ‘Best Live Act, Best Label and Best Compilation’ in the prestigious 2012 DJ Mag Spain awards, and he also won the ‘Best of 2011’ award in DEEJAY Magazine. His constant growth has enabled him to spread his music to new audiences and is, without doubt, one of the bright new talents on the global electronic music scene.]]>

      <![CDATA[Dancefloor experimentalist and top Detroit techno producer Carl Craig has few equals in terms of the artistry, influence, and diversity of his recordings.]]>
    </biointro>
    <bio>
      <![CDATA[Carl Craig is described as a creative visionary, an electronic music icon, an esteemed Grammy-nominated composer, a world-class DJ and an ambassador for
his native Detroit. Yet the common thread that runs through Craig’s broad musical
canon and creative projects is a resounding fascination with futurism. The prolific
producer has cultivated a unique path as an artist, entrepreneur and civic leader,
guided by his tendency toward forward thinking.

“My livelihood is making music that I can perform, whether I’m doing orchestral
production or modular strangeness or generating club music. I don’t restrict
myself,” said Craig. “I defined myself by being who I am. The ultimate self respect
is when you say you’re going to do something and you go and do it to the best of
your ability.”

Craig released his first track in 1989 on a Virgin UK compilation album, with two
singles following on labels run by his first collaborator Derrick May. After a series
of ambitious releases for his co-owned Retroactive imprint, in 1991 Craig launched
his second record label Planet E with the groundbreaking EP “4 Jazz Funk Classics”,
under his alias 69. Planet-E turned 20 in 2011 and Craig celebrated the label’s
history by taking Planet-E and its artists and collaborators on a world tour for the
first time ever. He also previewed the 69 Live show for the first time, at select
festivals around the world, fusing masks, darkness and the music of 69, Craig
created 69’s own entity. As well as this, Planet-E invited friends of the label – like
Luciano, Kirk Del Giorgio, Loco Dice and more - to pick their favourite Planet-E
track to remix and re-release. Reflecting a year that was packed with events and
releases, Craig readily admits that when he started the label he was hoping “it
would last forever.” He cites artistic freedom as the highlight of running the label
and adds, “It was never a struggle for the label to be an outlet for my or other
people's music. It was always a struggle to stay in business, actually a war to stay
in business.”

Looking back now to Craig's early releases from 1989-1992, one can see how much
the wild variety found in his early music set the groundwork for his diverse career.
He's fortunate to serve as an inspiration and influence to countless artists in the
underground electronic music scene as well as crossover acts like Underworld,
Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem. His 1992 Innerzone Orchestra cut “Bug in the
Bassbin” was credited as the spark that inspired the evolution of drum‘n’bass.
In typical Craig fashion, “Bug...” continued to develop, morphing into a live jazz
composition in 1996. In turn, those experiments laid the ground for Craig to
incorporate Jazz elements onto his 1999 I.O. album “Programmed.” Then in the 00's
Craig explored jazz further still as producer on the albums “The Detroit Experiment”
and “Rebirth” (2009) for legendary Detroit Jazz collective Tribe. This is but one
example of Craig's continually evolving exploration of sound.

Craig’s prolific nature is reflected in the many recording projects he has used
throughout his career including 69, BFC, C2, Innerzone Orchestra, No
Boundaries, Psyche, Paperclip People and Tres Demented. This rotating
cast of aliases has enabled him to continually explore new directions through
a long succession of full length albums, mix CDs and singles including “Throw”
(1994), “Landcruising” (1995), “The Secret Tapes of Dr Eich” (1996), “More Songs
About Food and Revolutionary Art” (1997), “Programmed” (1999), “The Detroit
Experiment” (2002), “The Workout” (2002), “Just Another Day” (2004), “Fabric 25”
(2005), “The Album Formerly Known As” (2005), “Paris Live” (2007), “Sessions”

(2008), “Recomposed” (with Moritz Von Oswald) (2008), “The Legendary
Adventures of a Filter King” (2009) and “Modular Pursuits” (2010).

Craig’s interest in collaboration continually grows. As "Versus", one of his boldest
endeavors to date, Craig combines techno and classical music, opening himself up
to working in a new format by collaborating with orchestrator / pianist Francesco
Tristano, French orchestra Les Siècles, conductor Francois Xavier Roth and Moritz
Von Oswald. Inspired by well-received performances in large concerts halls in
Paris, Milan and Germany, Craig started the process of developing the project
into an album. He also performs as Trio alongside Von Oswald and Tristano. His
occasional appearances with the electronic collective jam band Narod Niki, alongside
Villalobos, Luciano, Richie Hawtin, Zip and others, have led to him appearing in
part live / part DJ gigs with Luciano. Additionally he’s taken to occasionally bringing
keyboardists like Mike Banks (UR), Amp Fiddler and Tristano into the DJ booth
with him for special one-off gigs. These mixed performances add some variety
in a non-stop DJ schedule that finds him spinning at top clubs worldwide. Craig
acknowledges, “Touring has always been the most important aspect of the music
industry for artists. There will always be that desire for human interaction.”. Lets
also mention that he has recently performed live soundtracks to films, first in
Amsterdam then in New York, where he improvised live to an Andy Warhol film at
Unsound Festival. The fact is, unpredictability is the only predictable thing about
Craig and his music.

Outside of his Planet E recordings, Craig also continues to be one of the most
sought-after remixers in the world. Craig has produced a seemingly never-ending
list of remixes that now extends over 100 cuts, including mixes for the likes of LCD
Soundsystem, Hot Chip, Friendly Fires, Caribou, Theo Parrish, Gavin Russom &amp; Delia
Gonzalez, Tori Amos, Can, Goldfrapp, Unkle, Yello and others. He was nominated
for a Grammy in 2008 for his mix of the Junior Boys “Like a Child.” “It’s been
proven that the remix is a valid art form,” Craig said. “When I take on a project, the
ultimate goal is that it becomes my record. In many cases I’m actually recomposing
the track and the time that I spend reflects how personal it becomes.” Fortunately
there is no shortage of artists looking for that Carl Craig touch, so rest assured
you'll hear Craig reconfiguring many of your favorite artists for years to come.

In the same way that he likes to make tracks he's remixing his own, Craig’s
commitment to his home in Detroit is also something very personal. After launching
a festival to rival that of any in Europe with the Detroit Electronic Music Festival in
2000, Craig has shifted his focus to even more ambitious goals with the creation
of his non-profit 501-C3 Carl Craig Foundation. “The concept is to find ways to re-
educate kids about what’s interesting musically that you can’t get on the radio” says
Craig. Partnering with other non-profits to set up music scholarships, in 2010 the
Carl Craig Foundation presented a five-day workshop during the Movement Festival
at the Detroit School of the Arts, which exposed the students to professionals
in sound engineering, music festival production, record/music production and
musical performance. Craig sees the primary goal of the foundation as a way “to
develop a new music scene that follows the legacy of Detroit music being diverse
and interesting, to spot out the most talented young musicians coming out of high
school and lend small financial grants to encourage music education at a higher
level.”

This commitment to Detroit music also extends to how his Planet E family of
labels is run. Not only has it given a home to a wide range of Detroit-based
artists including Francesco Mora Catlett, Naomi Daniel, Flexitone, Jason Hogans,

Kenny Larkin, Monty Luke, Ezana Harris, Moodyman, Mike Agent X, Oliverwho
Factory, Recloose, Reference, Kevin Saunderson, Big Tone, Tribe, Urban Tribe,
and Chaz Vincent, it has also been serving as a distributor for Detroit imprints
including Derrick May's Transmat and Stacey Pullen's Black Flag. “The reality of the
business is that you have to change. That’s a very difficult process, especially as
an independent. I made a conscious decision a few years ago to invest in what I
do. It’s turning it around and putting it into the studio and the label for my music
to develop. We’re fighters around here. We fight to find new ways of selling. We
do manufacture vinyl and there are people who want it. We’re fighting to keep it
alive. Fighting for music that we have a vision for,” Craig say about Detroit. “My
commitment to the city is like a commitment to your family. I’ve been here all my
life and I’ve seen great things happen elsewhere, why not be involved in making my
home great?”

When Craig explains his philosophy, his wry sense of humor seeps into his
explanations of far-reaching concepts that merge worlds together. “I have a very
special career. When I feel that I’m tired of going on the road I can go in the studio.
When I’m tired of concentrating on the studio I can go on the road. I can work with
concert pianists, jazz musicians or rock guys. Very few people have that range of
interests. Very few people juggle a career that they choose specifically.” No one else
can pull it all together quite like Carl Craig.]]>

      <![CDATA[Jeff Mills, along with Robert Hood, Carl Craig, and Joey Beltram, is one of the biggest American names in techno. Championed for his music's relentless pursuit of hardness and his stripped-down, almost industrial DJ sets, Mills is the latest in a long line of Detroit-bred talent to take on an international reputation. ]]>
    </biointro>
    <bio>
      <![CDATA[A founding member of noted Motor City institution Underground Resistance, Mills helped build the artist roster and label ideology (as well as much of its back catalog) with partners "Mad" Mike Banks and Robert "Noise" Hood before moving to New York in 1992 to pursue more vigorously his solo and DJ career (with a resident spot at the legendary Limelight and a recording contract with the noted German label Tresor). (Although rumors of bad blood between the early UR crew have been denied by all involved, Mills' decision to split was apparently total, with Banks all but repudiating his involvement with Mills and Mills distancing himself from the continuing political militancy of Banks and the UR organization.) 

Mills' UR-related releases (including "The Punisher" and "Seawolf") are stripped-down and erratic, fusing elements of hardcore acid and industrial techno to the sparse Detroit aesthetic. Not surprisingly, his post-UR sound hasn't eased a bit, although UR's penchant for the four-track has been replaced by higher-quality production.

Prior to his involvement in UR, Mills was a DJ at Detroit public radio station WDET (he was also studying architecture at the time), spinning everything from Meat Beat Manifesto and Nine Inch Nails to Chicago house and underground Detroit techno. He began producing in the mid-'80s, working with Tony Srock on the project the Final Cut. 

Mills met Banks through a local garage group Members of the House, who Banks was working with in the late '80s. Mills remixed a track on a Members 12-inch, and his and Banks' shared love for Chicago soul and the harder edge of Detroit techno blossomed into Underground Resistance as a combined business and creative enterprise. The pair, along with Robert Hood, recorded several EPs and singles together, including tracks such as "Waveform," and "Sonic," before Mills defected to New York in 1992 to pursue a residency at the Limelight club and a solo career recording for Tresor and his own label, Axis. Mills' discography includes two full-length volumes of Waveform Transmissions for Tresor, a live album and rarities collection for the British label React, and the first album in a new contract with Sony Japan, as well as a handful of 12-inch EPs on Axis and several collaborations with Robert Hood on his M-Plant label. In 2000, Mills took more memorable action by scoring a new soundtrack for Fritz Lang's 1926 film Metropolis, screened around the world at venues including the Museum of Music in Paris, London's Royal Albert Hall, and the Vienna International Film Festival.
